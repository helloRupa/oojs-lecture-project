# Object-Oriented JavaScript
Here's what we'll be building together today using JS class syntax:

Some of this has already been built out. We'll be adding some functionality to the parent class and creating one child class to practice our OO JS skills.

## By the end of the lesson, you should be able to:
Declare a class in JavaScript - including instance methods, class methods, and instance variables - and instantiate new objects from it. 

We also have two secondary goals:
- Declare a child class
- Be able to explain context (`this`) at a high level and recognize errors that occur when `this` is no longer what we expect it to be. You are not expected to walk away today having fully understood `this`. It takes practice, a lot of experimenting with code, and reading to fully grasp, so be kind to yourself if you find `this` confusing.

## Wait, but why?
- Easier to organize our code
- Easier to share, reuse, and edit code at a later date
- Necessary for React development (aka MOD 4)
- Don't have a dumpster fire of functions and variables floating around

## Outline
- Declare a class, including instance variables, instance methods, and class methods
- Distinguish between `this` in JS and `self` in Ruby
- Declare a child class and get familiar with `super` (`super` is the same in Ruby)
- Finish the silly webpage using class syntax
