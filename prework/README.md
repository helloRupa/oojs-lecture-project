# OO JS Prework
Please complete this reading before today's lecture. If you have time, also play with the code in this folder a bit.

## Good to know
JavaScript class syntax is just syntactic sugar. Technically, it adds nothing new to the language, but rather a new syntax for doing the same old things JavaScript was already able to do. Think of it like this: If you paint the exterior of an old house, you're just making it look different, maybe even a bit nicer. However, it's still the same old house inside with the same old features.

## Please open superstar.rb and superstar.js in the split editor so you can see them side by side
I want you to see how Ruby class syntax and JavaScript class syntax relate to each other. This should help you understand this syntax more easily, or so I hope.

To play with the JS code, copy and paste it into the Dev Tools console.

Most important things to look out for:
- constructor()
- instance variables (aka instance properties)
- instance methods (aka prototype methods)
    - two ways to declare them
    - we'll go over the difference in lecture: `this`
- inheritance syntax
